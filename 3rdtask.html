In 1875, a Sitamarhi subdistrict was created within the Muzaffarpur district.[4] Sitmarhi was detached from Muzaffarpur and became a separate district as of 11 December 1972.[5] It is situated in the northern part of Bihar. The district headquarters is located in Dumra, five kilometers south of Sitamarhi.[clarification needed]
